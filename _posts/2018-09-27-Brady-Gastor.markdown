Brady Gaster is a senior program manager in the ASP.NET team at Microsoft, where he works on SignalR, microservices and APIs, and integration with Azure service teams in hopes to make it exciting for developers who work on .NET apps to party in the cloud. You can find Brady on Twitter or Twitch at @bradygaster when he's not learning with (or from) his 2 sons, tinkering with code, or making music in his basement using various synthesizers and guitars.
