Kathleen Dollard loves to code and loves to teach and talk about code. She’s written tons of articles, a book, and spoken around the world. She’s on the .NET Core Team at Microsoft where she works on the .NET Core CLI and SDK. If you’re not sure what all those acronyms mean…just ask her. She’s always ready to help developers take the next step in exploring the wonderful world we call code.
