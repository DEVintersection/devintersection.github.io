Barry is the security curmudgeon for ASP.NET which means he gets to look at the framework, tools and template code, searching for potential insecurities and sometimes even fixing them. He also triages publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities before getting someone else to fix them which means he gets all of the fun and none of the responsibility.

Here are links to his presentation material:
